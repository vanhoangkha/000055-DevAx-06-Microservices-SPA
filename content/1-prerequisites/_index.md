Welcome to the first module in this workshop! This module involves getting access to a developer environment that we’ve provisioned for you. The developer environment contains all the software and network access required to get you up and running with the labs in record time.

We’ve chosen to do this as the main aim for this workshop is learning the content in each module, not setting up your local machines. It also provides a consistent environment between you and your fellow colleagues to eliminate the weird “works on my machine” behavior.

If you were planning on running this lab on your own machine, you’ll have to adapt the instructions accordingly. Make sure to manually install the software listed in the **Development Environment** section below.
